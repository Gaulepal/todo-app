# todo-app for Watch & Code course by Gordon Zhu
Project for the Practical JS class by Gordon Zhu.  

##About
The course 'Practical JavaScript' can be found here: http://watchandcode.com/courses/practical-javascript

This course teaches a practical application for JS.  The goal is to build a todo-list application.  We start with a super basic one. 
Then in each version we add functionality, based on the new specs, and practice using new JS concepts. 

The program is built in Plunker (plnkr.co):  https://embed.plnkr.co/7XGbITx7KkZPcMvJmei0/ because Plunker allows miltiple JS files for a project. 

This repo is to show my progress of building this scalable app.
